About
=====

NAPI Native addon for Windows DLL injection with support for Wow64 and Unicode path.

This is a simple injector using the classic `createRemoteThread()` + `LoadLibrary()` from `Kernel32` combo.

- x64 injector
  + can inject x64 DLL into x64 processes.
  + can inject x86 DLL into x86 processes (Wow64).
- x86 injector 
  + can inject x86 DLL into x86 processes.

Example

```js
import { spawn } from "node:child_process";
import { dirname } from "node:path";
import { createRemoteThread } from "@xan105/remote-thread";

const EXECUTABLE = "G:\\foo\\bar.exe";
const ADDON = "G:\\foo\\‰∫∫Âêç.dll";

const binary = spawn(EXECUTABLE, [], {
  cwd: dirname(EXECUTABLE),
  stdio:[ "ignore", "ignore", "ignore" ], 
  detached: true
});

binary.once("error", (err) => {
  console.error(err);
});

binary.once("spawn", () => {
  binary.unref();
  //DLL Injection
  createRemoteThread(binary.pid, ADDON);
});
```

Installation
